    <p> We cannot choose our family as we choose our friends,
        <br> but I can say that I'm blessed with a wonderful family.
        <br> My family are very small with five members as above.
    </p> </center>

    <p> My father's name is Suhaimi Abu Bakar. He is 53 years old. He is a soldier pension. Now, he is currently self employed. 
    <br> My mother's name is Suyati Binti Kamin. She is 52 years old. She is a public sector employees. 
    <br> Next, my elder brother's name is Norsyamierul Syazriez and he is 25 years old. He is working with my father. 
    <br> Last but not least, my younger brother's name is Nursyazriezal Syazwan and he's still studying. He is 16 years old. 
    </p>

    <p>My family is like a strong pillar for me, on which I can rely blindly anytime I require support. 
        <br> I am beyond grateful because I have such a supportive and loving family. 
        <br> My family are  my motivation and roots to all of my reason why I am struggling with what I am doing now. 
        <br> We do not have much money or wealth but what my family has in abundance is love for each other which cannot be replaced by anything else in this world.
    </br> </p> 

    <p>I have always grown up believing that it is the environment that defines a person's qualities and characteristics.
      <br>  A person's "environment" is does not limit to where that person lives, it can also be the people who have a defining influence in that person's life. 
        <br>These people, in one way or another, are role models that shape the way we think, act and make decisions. 
       <br>  I like to think that my parents are huge contributors to my environment and they have a large role in raising me to be the person I am today. 
        <br> They are positive role models to me and they force me to think to think responsible to be a better person. 
        <br> They taught me that I could achive anyting with a good education, a solid goal, and an unfaltering determination.
