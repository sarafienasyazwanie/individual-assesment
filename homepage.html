<p> This personal website is an Individual Assignment for ISM456 
<br> Below is one of my favorite article about dream big 
<br> Enjoy your reading!
</p> </center>

<p>When you're growing up you're told to dream big, reach for the stars, and you can be whatever you want to be. 
<br> More than likely you have big dreams for yourself: being a doctor, a teacher, an attorney, the list can go on forever. 
<br> Sometimes society steps in and tells you that your dreams are too big. You wonder how a dream can be too big? 
<br> The thought and possible action may even come to give up on that dream. You should never give up on your dreams. </br> </p>

<p> At some point in your life, someone has looked at you and said your dreams (or aspirations) are not possible for you because you are a girl. 
<br> Don't ever listen to them. First, no one but you knows what you are capable of doing. No one knows the drive you may have for chasing after a goal of yours. 
<br>Find ways to prove that person wrong. Just because you are a girl doesn't mean you're incapable of having big dreams.
</p> </br>

<p> Don't let people bring you down. You will face all kinds of adversity while achieving these big dreams for yourself. 
<br> Some people may look at you and say you're crazy for wanting to do this, but they don't know you. 
<br> They don't know what you are capable of doing and how long you have wanted this. 
<br> Keep your head up and know that you can do whatever you set your mind too. 
<br> This will just be a bump in the road for you, so let it roll off you. 
<br> There are so many reasons why someone may want to bring your hopes down on achieving your dream. 
<br>  They could be jealous of your willpower to move on, could be that they wish they had the confidence you do. 
<br>  Keep moving forward and never look back.
