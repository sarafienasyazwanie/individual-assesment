  <p> During my diploma at UiTM Kedah, I have gained lots of new knowledge and experiences in my participation in many events.
  <br> So I am going to tell you about my experiences. </p> </br> </center>

  <p> As you can see the pictures above. They are my friends that I got when I passed to join Office Management Student's Association (OMSA)  
  <br> In OMSA, I started as normal members for the first semester. After it, my club's advisor choose me to be Leader of Entrepreneurship Exco. 
  <br> At first, I'm quite scared if I can't do a good job. But as the time goes by, I learnt a lot from my senior and I doing better 
  <br> in handling work matters relating to entrepreneurship. When I'm in OMSA club, I managed many events such as :
  <ul>
      <li> Dean List's Camp </li> 
      <li> "Karnival Usahanita Siri 1 dan Siri 2" </li>
      <li> “Program Tautan Kasih” with Office Management Club, UiTM Melaka </li>
      <li> Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Program at Kampung Jerlun, Kedah </li>
  <p>I participate in OMSA from zero til I know everything in handling event and dealing with high-rank people.
  </p> </br> </center>

  <p> I am going to explain a little bit on how the program functioning below </p>

  <p> In Dean List's Camp, I'm on duty as secretary of the event. My position requires me to settle all 
      <br> the paperwork involving the successful of the camp. Throughout the event, I'm busy managing all
      <br> the dean list's student activities schedule. I need to observe and make sure that everyone participate 
      <br> in every activity and stay healthy. This is because our camp were held in the jungle.
      <br> "Karnival Usahanita Siri 1 and Siri 2 were being handled by me and all OMSA's member. 
      <br> I need to create a schedule to handle the booth that fits into all member's class schedule
    <br> Eventhough it's quite exhausting, but thankfully everyone did a great job. </ul>p>
<p> Next, "Program Tautan Kasih" was very special because it involves OMAC from UiTM Melaka.
     <br> We did some pretty fun activities such as malay dance and sharing knowledge regarding our both club. 
    <br> Lastly, during CSR at Kampung Jerlun I joined many great activities such as replantation of mangrove trees,
    <br> cleaning the 'surau' and others.

  <p> In January 2017, while waiting for my SPM's result, I worked as part-time teacher at Tadika Shimah, Kangar, Perlis. 
  <br> At there, I learnt on how to manage babies and toddlers. I also became to be more patiently with people. People may think that handling 
  <br> toddlers are easy but in reality it's really tough job and drained my energy fastly. But, working with children has reminded me 
  <br> of how amazing and exciting the world can be. I love seeing things from their eyes, so pure and such a cutie. It makes me a happier and more positive person 
  <br> in my day-to-day life. Children also encourage me to use my imagination and find new creative ways to do things.
